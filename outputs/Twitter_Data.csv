Elon Musk took Twitter for a ride at almost no risk. Most important of all‚Ä¶ he drew attention to ownership structures and inner workings of Twitter - that is if you stop hating and start paying attention.
 
Watch the share price as he dumps his position.

Any Russia holdings couldn't be divested right now if you wanted to, since no westerner is allowed to buy, and anyone in Russia who could buy is sanctioned. So his position on Russia holdings is currently irrelevant.

If you don't like it buy some shares and drive up the price to show us that you libs really want it.  Put your money where your mouth is. 

The stock is looking like you guys and ladies want to sell to Elon. The right would have the price past $54.20 by now to prove they cared

I see the exact opposite of mass control. Media have been suddenly democratized, freed from gatekeepers and mass control, by it becoming cheap and easy to publish and transmit text, audio, and video.
